Think you are an elite enterprise-grade full-stack front-end architect, senior UI/UX director, cinematic motion designer, performance engineer, and production-level build expert with 15+ years of experience building premium technology and creative studio platforms.

Your task is to build the complete, production-ready web application for my agency “Quickserve IT” from scratch, inside this workspace, with real working code, real structure, real animations, real performance optimization, and real deployment readiness. This is not a concept, not a demo, and not a wireframe. This is a final, real website project that I will push to GitHub and deploy on Vercel.

You must design through code, engineer everything professionally, and ensure the site looks, feels, and performs like a million-dollar private technology & cinematic creative studio platform.

✅ 1. BRAND & POSITIONING (ABSOLUTE RULE)

Brand Name everywhere in UI:
→ Quickserve IT

Do NOT show .online anywhere in the visible interface.

The domain will be used later only for hosting (example: quickserveit.online), not as branding.

The website must feel like:

A confidential institutional technology partner

A futuristic cinematic AI-powered creative studio

A high-trust, high-status digital operation

The brand personality must communicate:

Authority

Precision

Speed

Security

Innovation

Creative dominance

✅ 2. TECHNOLOGY STACK (STRICTLY ENFORCED)

You must build using:

Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Language: TypeScript (strict mode)

Styling: Tailwind CSS + CSS variables

Animations: Framer Motion (GPU-only animations)

Particles: Lightweight Canvas 2D particle engine

Rendering: 100% Static Export (No backend, no server functions, no API routes)

Deployment: Vercel-ready

Code Quality: ESLint + Prettier

This must be a fully static, front-end-only web app, optimized for:

Desktop

Laptop

Tablet

Mobile

✅ 3. RESPONSIVE & AUTO-ADJUSTABLE DESIGN (VERY IMPORTANT)

The website must be:

Fully responsive

Fluid auto-adjusting layout

Perfect on:

4K monitors

Standard laptops

Tablets

Mobile phones (small & large)

Rules:

Layout must auto-scale using fluid grids.

Font sizes must auto-adjust using responsive typography.

Particles & heavy effects must auto-reduce on mobile for performance.

No element must ever break, overflow, or clip on any screen size.

This is a premium adaptive UI system, not a fixed layout.

✅ 4. DUAL EXPERIENCE SYSTEM (VERY IMPORTANT)

The website must operate in two distinct emotional & visual modes:

1️⃣ Corporate Command Mode

Used on:

Home

Institute Services

Pricing

About

Contact
This mode must feel:

Serious

Government-grade

Secure

Structured

Calm

Trust-driven

2️⃣ Cinematic AI Studio Mode

Used on:

Creative Studio

Portfolio
This mode must feel:

Cinematic

Futuristic

Creative

AI-powered

Emotionally inspiring

Visually powerful

The transition between these two modes must feel like entering a new digital world, not just a color change.

✅ 5. GLOBAL VISUAL SYSTEM
🎨 Colors

Deep Carbon Black for main backgrounds

Premium Gold / Royal Yellow for:

CTAs

Active states

Highlights

AI Blue rim-light ONLY inside Creative Studio & Portfolio

No neon.
No childish gradients.
Everything must feel luxury, controlled, and expensive.

✅ 6. CORE INTERACTION SYSTEMS (MUST BE BUILT)
✅ Cursor-Reactive Particle System

Built using Canvas 2D

Slow floating particles

Cursor creates repulsion effect

Particles intelligently move away from cursor

Automatic performance throttling on mobile

Auto-disable on prefers-reduced-motion

Particles change energy level in Creative Studio mode

✅ Typewriter Text System

Used ONLY on:

Hero headline

Cinematic scene titles

Smooth character reveal

Elegant blinking cursor

Looks like AI thinking live

✅ Premium Button System

All buttons must have:

Gold glowing edges

Soft fade hover

Micro scale interaction

Light sweep reflection

✅ Dynamic Time-Based Greeting System

Morning → “Good morning, let’s build something powerful today.”

Afternoon → “Good afternoon, ready to upgrade your workflow?”

Late Night → “Late-night work? Quickserve IT is ready.”

This must be automatic and animated softly.

✅ Auto-Refreshing Insight Box

A smart box that shows:

Tips

Quotes

Creative & business wisdom

Changes on every page reload

Soft glow + fade-in animation

✅ 7. REQUIRED PAGES (ALL MUST BE BUILT)
