Think you are an elite UI/UX architect and motion engineer specializing in luxury enterprise navigation systems, and your task is to design and build a complete, production-ready, ultra-premium navigation system for the brand “Quickserve IT” that works flawlessly across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile with automatic layout adjustment and perfect performance; the navigation must be a sticky, top-level header with the brand name “Quickserve IT” on the left, primary links centered (Home, Institute Services, Creative Studio, Portfolio, Pricing, About, Contact), and a high-contrast premium CTA button on the right (e.g., “Get Started” or “Secure Contact”), with smooth height reduction on scroll, soft background blur, and subtle shadow separation from content; the visual theme must follow a luxury black-and-gold system with deep carbon black as the base, premium gold/yellow only for active states and CTAs, and absolutely no neon or template styling; all hover states must use micro-scale motion, soft gold glow edges, and refined fade transitions using GPU-only properties (transform and opacity), and active links must show a controlled gold underline or light sweep to indicate state without visual noise; the navigation must intelligently adapt between two experience modes—Corporate Command Mode (calm, minimal motion, official feel) and Cinematic AI Studio Mode (slightly more expressive motion, subtle rim lighting, and cinematic easing) without breaking consistency; on mobile, the system must transform into a full-screen off-canvas drawer or slide-in panel with large, thumb-friendly tap targets, clear visual hierarchy, background dimming, focus trapping, and smooth open/close animation with proper accessibility support; the navigation must be fully keyboard-accessible with visible focus rings, ARIA labels, semantic nav landmarks, escape-key close for mobile menu, and full screen-reader compatibility; performance rules must ensure zero layout shift, no heavy reflows, no blocking scripts, and instant interaction even on low-end devices; if any part of the navigation feels cluttered, slow, low-contrast, confusing, or visually cheap, you must automatically simplify it, rebalance spacing, adjust motion timing, and upgrade it to enterprise-grade quality while preserving the premium Quickserve IT identity.
